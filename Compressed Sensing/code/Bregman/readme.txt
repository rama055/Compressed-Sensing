Coordinate Descent Optimization for l^1 Minimization

This code implements the algorithm proposed in CAM Report 09-17.
Yingying Li and Stanely Osher, "Coordinate Descent Optimization for l^1 Minimization with Application to Compressed Sensing; a Greedy Algorithm". 

COORDL1BREG is the main function.
COORDL1BREGDEMO shows an example of using COORDL1BREG. 
COORDLSL1 solves the least squares l^1 subproblem.
